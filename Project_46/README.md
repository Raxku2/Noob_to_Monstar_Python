# 🧠 Project_46: Create a Problem-Solving Prompt Sheet

**Author: Pinaka**

---

## 🎯 What Is This Project?

This project is **not about code**.

It’s about **thinking before code**.

A **Problem-Solving Prompt Sheet** is a set of **mental questions** you ask yourself **before, during, and after** writing code.

Good programmers don’t type fast.
They **ask better questions**.

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters (Very Important)

Most beginners fail because they:

* jump into coding too early
* don’t understand the problem fully
* panic when stuck
* don’t know *what* to think next

This sheet acts like:

* a **GPS for logic**
* a **debugging compass**
* a **confidence booster**

You can use it in:

* exams
* interviews
* projects
* hackathons
* real jobs

---

## 🧱 How to Use This Sheet

When you see a problem:

1. **Pause**
2. **Read the prompts**
3. **Answer them in your head or on paper**
4. Then code

> If you can answer the prompts,
> the code writes itself.

---

## 🟢 SECTION 1: Understanding the Problem

Ask yourself:

* What is the **input**?
* What is the **output**?
* Is the input:

  * single value?
  * multiple values?
  * string / number / list?
* What exactly is being asked?
* Can I explain the problem in **one simple sentence**?

🔑 **Golden rule**

> If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it yet.

---

## 🟢 SECTION 2: Constraints & Rules

Ask:

* Any limits? (size, length, range)
* Are negative values allowed?
* Are spaces/special characters involved?
* Should output be exact or formatted?
* Are there hidden edge cases?

Examples:

* empty string
* zero
* one element
* duplicate values

---

## 🟢 SECTION 3: Examples (Mandatory)

Force yourself to ask:

* What happens if input is smallest possible?
* What happens if input is largest?
* Try **1–2 manual examples** on paper.

Example:

```
Input: "banana"
Expected output: "ban"
```

If you can’t manually solve one example → **stop coding**.

---

## 🟢 SECTION 4: Breaking Into Steps

Ask:

* Can I break this into **smaller steps**?
* Which step comes first?
* Can each step be written in plain English?

Example:

```
1. Take input
2. Loop through characters
3. Check condition
4. Store result
5. Print output
```

This is **pseudocode thinking**.

---

## 🟢 SECTION 5: Data & Tools Choice

Ask:

* Do I need:

  * variable?
  * list?
  * dictionary?
  * counter?
* Do I need a loop?
* Do I need a condition?
* Do I need nested logic?

🔑 Ask **why** for every tool.

---

## 🟢 SECTION 6: Before Writing Code

Final check:

* Do I know:

  * where the loop starts?
  * where it ends?
  * what changes inside the loop?
* Do I know the variable names?
* Can I predict the output **before running**?

If yes → code.

If no → think again.

---

## 🟡 SECTION 7: While Coding (Anti-Panic Prompts)

When stuck, ask:

* What is my variable value **right now**?
* Is the loop running too many times?
* Did I forget to update something?
* Can I `print()` intermediate values?
* Is the condition ever becoming false?

> Debugging = observing, not guessing.

---

## 🟡 SECTION 8: After Coding (Verification)

Ask:

* Does it work for:

  * normal input?
  * empty input?
  * edge case?
* Is output exactly as required?
* Can I simplify this?
* Can I explain this solution to someone else?

If you can explain → you truly understand.

---

## 🔴 SECTION 9: Interview-Level Prompts

Train these thoughts:

* What is the **time complexity**?
* What is the **space usage**?
* Can this be optimized?
* Is readability more important here?
* What trade-off did I choose?

---

## 🧠 Master Prompt (Use This Always)

Before coding, say:

> “What is changing,
> what is staying same,
> and when does it stop?”

This single prompt solves **80% problems**.

---

## 🧪 Practice Exercise (Do This Now)

Take any old problem you solved and answer:

* Which prompt helped most?
* Which prompt you skipped?
* Where did you rush?

That awareness = growth.

---

## 🏁 Final Truth (Pin This)

> Coding is not typing.
> Coding is **thinking made visible**.

This prompt sheet turns:

* confusion → clarity
* fear → control
* guessing → logic
